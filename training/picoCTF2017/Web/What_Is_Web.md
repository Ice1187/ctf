[Web] What Is Web
===

## Description

Someone told me that [some guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) came up with the "World Wide Web", using "HTML" and "stuff". Can you help me figure out what that is? [Website](http://shell2017.picoctf.com:62230/).
* HINTS

    * How can you figure out how the webpage is actually built?

## Solution 
當然是先看源碼(html)
